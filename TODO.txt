Bugs:
1) Transition fucks up the login page and duplicates it in the bottom :(

General:
1) Ask around what legally do I need before I register users. GDPR, Privacy Policy, Cookies, COPA?
2) Add an animation/logo as a placeholder when the page loads
3) What sizes should I consider when making the page responsive? What are popular sizes? It has to be mobile first of
course!
4) Can you do transitions between pages different? So let's say there are page A,B and C. If you transition A -> C, the animation is one style. If you go B -> C - animation is a different style. Is it easy to do that in React transitions and is it even going to be worth doing something like that? I won't have a lot of pages in total which might be a fun little experiment trying to make a composition between all the pages and a little Easter egg? But will it be worth the work? Good to try as an experiment with the 3 pages mentioned above, and the creative work that needs to be done might be quite expensive as well 

Home page:
1) Buy Shutterstock 5x2 images so I don't have to deal with legal bs?
2) Change button to gradient + add transition on hover
3) Draw 3 awesome SVGs showing the underlying headers visually: Quality, Proactive, Community (maybe change Proactive to
something with -ty in the end that means active measures to removing negative affects in the system)
4) Come up with 3 creative headers :)
5) Come up with 3 short texts that will be shown on big screens and hidden on small mobile screens
6) Fix About button and make it bigger

Login:
1) Should I hide the Login button? Or replace it with something else?
2) Is there a way to make the button to fade away smoothly? :) https://medium.com/@khwsc1/step-by-step-guide-of-simple-routing-transition-effect-for-react-with-react-router-v4-and-9152db1566a0

Not found:
1) Do a creative, funny picture that will be a good marketing tool that potential users might share; Something that is
related to conversations. Like "We're sorry that you've ended up here, how about <a>talking to someone</a> to make your
feel better? :)"

Coding:
1) Move all the colors to a single colors.js to reuse easily throughout the system?

Ideas:
1) When someone reports a bad behavior, thank them for their contribution and inform them that the measures were taken
